The Goal
Build something demo-ready that shows:
Clampacked: "Look how easy ordering groceries could be"
Community Water Taxi: "Look how Uber-like boat booking could work"
The combination: "These belong together — one app for island logistics"

Make it polished, fun, and undeniably useful. This is your pitch to both organizations + potential investors. Ship it this summer, revenue day 1.
